# Social Publish

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user already has prepared content and wants help placing it into a platform editor.

Use for:

- filling title, body, tags, topics, summary, category, cover, images, or videos.
- saving a draft when the platform supports drafts.
- stopping on the editor or final confirmation page when drafts are unavailable.
- helping the user finish manual review before they publish themselves.

Do not use this skill to write or optimize the content. Use `social-writer` for that.

## Hard Safety Boundary

This skill must not click final irreversible actions, including:

- publish, post, send, submit, create topic, submit for review, pay, boost, advertise, or equivalent controls.
- accepting original/advertising/legal declarations without user confirmation.
- bypassing login, CAPTCHA, SMS, 2FA, platform risk control, paid features, or account limits.

The final publish action must be performed manually by the user.

## Tools And Capabilities

This skill depends on visible browser automation and local file access:

- visible browser control: open pages, click, type, paste, inspect page state.
- Chrome or Edge remote debugging if required by the available browser automation tool.
- local file reading: load content from markdown/text files and verify media paths.
- clipboard or editor input: paste long articles, captions, tags, and structured fields.
- upload controls: upload images, videos, covers, or attachments when the user provided local paths.
- page state checks: re-read the page after navigation, login, upload, dialogs, or save actions.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the publishing task:
   - platform, content type, title, body source, tags/topics, media paths, cover, summary, category, author, and login state.
   - whether "save draft" is required or stopping in the editor is acceptable.
2. Prepare content:
   - read local files if requested.
   - verify image/video paths exist.
   - preserve original content; do not silently rewrite.
3. Open the platform editor:
   - use a visible browser.
   - if login, CAPTCHA, 2FA, account risk, or payment appears, stop and let the user handle it.
4. Fill fields carefully:
   - inspect the page before interacting.
   - fill one field at a time.
   - upload media and wait for completion before continuing.
   - after page changes, inspect again and avoid stale element references.
5. Handle platform-specific choices:
   - ask the user for ambiguous declarations, category choices, copyright/original settings, ad labels, cover cropping, or paid promotion.
   - do not guess high-impact settings.
6. Stop safely:
   - save draft if available and verify the save state when possible.
   - otherwise stop in the editor or pre-publish confirmation page.
   - explicitly report which final action was not clicked.

## Platform Scope

Stable or expected targets:

- Xiaohongshu: image/text/long-form draft preparation.
- WeChat Official Account: article draft preparation.
- X: compose box preparation, draft/stop before post.
- Zhihu: answer/post/idea preparation.
- Weibo: compose preparation; may need to stop in editor if draft support is weak.
- Juejin: article draft preparation.
- Linux.do: topic draft preparation; stop before creating topic.

Other platforms can be attempted only after inspecting the actual page flow.
